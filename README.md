# Learning-CPP
From total beginner, my process of learning C++. 

I go through all the basics of the language in the hopes of becoming proficient in it. 

Things that have been covered so far:
	- Basic arithmetic operators 
	- If-statements 
	- Control flow: Switch statements (fallthroughs etc.), goto statements etc.  
	- Namespaces 
	- Working with strings
