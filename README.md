# Learning-CPP
From total beginner, my process of learning C++. 

I go through all the basics of the language in the hopes of becoming proficient in it. 

Things that have been covered so far: Basic arithmetic operators, if-statements, control flow: switch statements (fallthroughs etc.), goto statements etc., namespaces, working with strings
